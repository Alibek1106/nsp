          <h4>BYOD for medium-sized businesses</h4>
          <div class="project-page-text" style="font-weight: 300; color: #333">
            <p class="project-page-text-p">Blog by Marie Hattar, Cisco Vice President, Enterprise Product and Technology Marketing Do you have complete visibility into who is using your network and what devices are connected to it? Has your company already started implementing the BYOD concept? Allowing employees to access the corporate network through their own devices can improve their productivity and collaboration. In addition, BYOD improves the customer experience and makes them more loyal. According to the Cisco IBSG Horizons study, 63% of IT leaders believe that the number of employee-owned devices on the corporate network will increase over the next two years. And this is not surprising, because many people want to use their own phones and tablets at work. While at the Cisco office, I often use my i-Phone and i-Pad. In doing so, I have found that BYOD truly improves my productivity. Thanks to Cisco's BYOD policy, our IT team is confident that the system remains secure no matter which of my devices is connected to the network. However, many companies have so far refrained from implementing such a policy. A recent study found that 40% of BYOD users haven't set a password on their phones, and two in five don't even use basic security protocols. Therefore, when starting to implement BYOD, you should first of all remember information security. Cisco recognizes the challenges that BYOD poses for midsize businesses. Our principle is simple: companies must be aware of the threats to their information security and of possible attacks through unprotected devices. We understand that mid-market businesses have limited IT talent and may not be able to invest heavily in their systems. And we know that your IT team has to ensure effective device access control to ensure that users don't accidentally leave your network vulnerable. That's why we've made BYOD easy. Now IT can quickly configure wired and wireless network security policies based on users, devices, and locations with just a few clicks. With Cisco's One Network, One Policy, One Management approach, IT now spends less time managing your network and can focus on innovating to grow your business. Recently, one of the largest European radio stations, Radio Max, moved to a new office and implemented the Cisco BYOD solution. Now employees and guests can easily connect their devices to the radio's secure network. “Despite the expansion of Radio Max's staff, which has increased by 10 percent over the past six months, network performance has improved significantly,” says Markus Stangl, technical coordinator and deputy head of technical department. The world is becoming more connected every day. The comprehensive Internet has firmly entered our lives and by 2020 will connect 50 billion material objects. This means more devices, more users, and more risks on your network.</p>

          <div class="project-page-text" style="font-weight: 300; color: #333">
            <p class="project-page-text-p">Schneider Electric, a global expert in the field of energy management, took part in the 21st International Oil and Gas Exhibition and Conference KIOGE 2013 from October 1 to October 4. “The opportunity to present comprehensive solutions for the country’s oil and gas sector and engineering systems of various classes is very important for Schneider Electric. The development of the direction “Energy efficiency of oil and gas industry enterprises” is one of the priorities for our company. As part of the specialized exhibition, Schneider Electric not only presented its developments, but also spoke about Schneider Electric as a global expert in this industry and found new opportunities for cooperation with other companies,” noted Kairat Aimbekov, segment manager of the Oil and Gas department. At its stand (place 10-215) in the tenth pavilion of the exhibition, Schneider Electric presented Smart Field projects - a solution for increasing production efficiency, reducing mechanical damage and downtime; Pipeline Management is a pipeline management solution that allows you to increase the level of reliability and safety, as well as reduce costs when transporting oil or gas; Energy Management and Control Systems (EMCS) is an automated energy management system for oil and gas facilities with support for the IEC 61850 standard and a service offering for enterprises. “The Schneider Electric stand was distinguished by its relevance and unique design. We made it quite informative, where visitors to the exhibition received the maximum understanding of our company’s core products, the possibility of their use in the oil and gas sector and the organization of oil and gas infrastructure,” emphasized Kairat Aimbekov.</p>

            <p class="project-page-text-p">The Skolkovo Foundation and Schneider Electric signed a cooperation agreement in the presence of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. The Skolkovo Foundation and Schneider Electric, one of the world leaders in the field of energy management, signed today an agreement to create an R&amp;D center in the energy-efficient Eco-Office building in the Skolkovo innovation city. The document was signed by the President of the Skolkovo Foundation, Viktor Vekselberg, and the Executive Vice President, Head of the Energy business unit of Schneider Electric, Frederic Abbal. The signing ceremony took place at the innovation center before a meeting of the Skolkovo Foundation Board of Trustees in the presence of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev. The activities of the Schneider Electric R&amp;D center will be aimed at creating improved power distribution control systems for electrical networks, developing control systems for autonomous generators and pipelines for various purposes, adapting Schneider Electric solutions for Russian conditions, etc. It is expected that by 2017 the number of personnel at the center will reach 100 Human. Schneider Electric has unique international experience and a large number of developments in the field of creating smart electrical networks. The company has a distributed network of competence centers in the field of Smart Grid, and the R&amp;D center in Skolkovo will become an important point on the global map of Schneider Electric R&amp;D activities. Schneider Electric is already implementing a number of pilot projects to implement Smart Grid in Russian regions. In the Eco-office project on the territory of the Skolkovo innovation city, Schneider Electric is implementing all of its most advanced solutions in the field of energy efficiency, as well as the concept of integrated energy management. All engineering systems of the building will be combined into a single intelligent control system, which will allow monitoring energy consumption over various periods of time and making an analytical assessment of consumption. This will allow optimizing the operation of systems and carrying out targeted measures to improve the energy efficiency of the building, taking into account analytics and changes in operating conditions. It is planned that these solutions will allow the Eco-Office</p>

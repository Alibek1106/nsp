            <p class="project-page-text-p">NSP, together with Fujitsu, provides Dynamic Data Center solutions Dynamic Data Center Concept In a dynamic data center, any service can run on any system. Services can be redistributed between systems very quickly. The first step to create a dynamic data center is to eliminate the rigid binding of services to specific hardware platforms - virtualization. All hardware resources (servers and storage systems) are grouped into a single pool, from which they can be flexibly allocated as needed. The functioning of virtual and physical resources is almost completely automated. In case of failure of any resource or its insufficient capacity or volume, corrective actions are initiated automatically: this is automation. Resources are automatically distributed between services based on predefined rules. These rules are based on specific business processes and agreements with resource users. These are specified in service level agreements. NSP Ltd Strategy - The Path to Dynamic Data Centers IT decision makers are faced with problems similar to trying to find the square of a circle! Their internal customers demand rapid integration of information technology into production processes, error-free operation and optimal support. At the same time, due to high costs, IT departments are constantly under the control of company management, and this hinders the expansion of IT services. The call to cut costs is the demand of the day. The only way to achieve this is to take a different path. By moving to dynamic data centers (Dynamic Data Center, DDC). Dynamic IT infrastructure (Dynamic IT) Data center - the path from costing center to strategic resource The ability to delimit service levels and then dynamically manage resource allocation to meet high demands, assign priorities processes in real time and in the blink of an eye, introducing new services with the right infrastructure whenever the business demands it is no longer the ultimate dream of IT managers... all these possibilities are made possible thanks to a dynamic IT infrastructure. Join our discussion, ask the experts your questions and learn how you can speed up the deployment of new services while simplifying operations. Flexibility is more important than ever - the ability to respond adequately to new challenges remains one of the most important tasks of any company, employed in the information technology industry. On servers running the Windows operating system, these problems are solved using Dynamic IT Infrastructure for Microsoft - a solution that allocates resources to applications exactly when they are needed. Consolidation of server resources helps cope with peak loads.

          <h4>Network hardware</h4>
          <div class="project-page-text" style="font-weight: 300; color: #333">
            <p class="project-page-text-p">NSP offers a range of networking solutions based on CISCO hardware. Cisco has the industry's most extensive portfolio of hardware used to build and provide access to information networks, plus the Cisco IOS operating system (designed to support network services and applications), design expertise and deployment of networks, as well as a system of technical support and professional services for maintaining and optimizing network performance. Cisco is unique in that it is able - alone or together with partners - to provide all of the above resources. Cisco serves customers in three target markets: - Large enterprises, i.e. large organizations with complex networking needs. As a rule, they have many departments where heterogeneous computer systems are installed. This group of customers includes corporations, government agencies, utilities and educational institutions. - Service providers - companies that provide information services, including telecom carriers, Internet access providers, cable companies and wireless carriers. - Small and medium-sized enterprises , needing their own data networks and the means to access the Internet and/or their business partners. Unlike many other technology companies, Cisco does not rigidly choose one technology or force that technology on customers. Cisco's philosophy is to listen carefully to the customer's needs, consider all possible technology alternatives, and provide the customer with a wide range of options to choose from. Cisco designs its products and solutions based on generally accepted industry standards. In some cases, technologies developed by Cisco have themselves become standard. The Network is a Platform Turning the network into a platform changes the entire technology chain and makes the network a focus for innovation. According to some estimates, by 2010 there will be 14 billion devices connected to the Internet. The rapid growth in the number of devices will continue to be driven by the emergence of more services and tasks performed online. These include telephone calls, personalized search services, video downloading, online gaming and other forms of entertainment. The network is becoming more than just infrastructure. It is evolving into a secure platform for delivering personalized services tailored to the needs of the 21st century customer - an operator introducing new services, a large or small enterprise increasing productivity, or an individual user seeking personalized entertainment and real-time services. As the intelligent network evolves into a platform, users have the ability to communicate using any device and communication channel they choose. Cisco is leading the industry toward a “network-centric” environment. By combining its strengths (IP) with intelligent technologies, the company is creating a powerful communications platform that will serve as the foundation for the convergence of data, voice, video and mobile communications in a single, secure, integrated architecture.</p>

          <h4>Intelligent building</h4>
          <div class="project-page-text" style="font-weight: 300; color: #333">
            <p class="project-page-text-p">NSP provides smart home solutions of any complexity. The company's engineers were trained in Belgium, Almaty and Perm. The Intelligent Building is a set of engineering and technical solutions and organizational measures aimed at creating a highly efficient, cost-effective Building Management System that best meets the needs of the users and owners of this Intelligent Building. Operational savings, a high level of safety and comfort are what distinguishes an intelligent building from a conventional one. This is achieved primarily through the integration of the main components of the building into a single information and control infrastructure and their interaction on the basis of a single data transmission medium, the basis of which is LAN/WAN , organized according to the principle of structured cable systems. What is the fundamental difference between an “intelligent building” and a conventional building, the engineering systems of which are built according to a traditional scheme? We can say that not only the owner of the building is worried about the state of engineering systems, but also a “correctly” designed building itself “worries” about the state of the systems and the living conditions of its inhabitants, providing them with completely different levels of comfort and safety. The owner of such a building does not waste time monitoring the operation of engineering equipment. This function is performed by automated control systems. They will not only turn on, turn off and adjust the operation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning, lighting and power supply systems, but will also inform the operator about possible problems with the systems and remind them of the need for routine maintenance. In the event of an emergency, they will activate the necessary equipment and notify building occupants of the routes and methods of evacuation. An important difference between modern control systems is simplicity, convenience and great savings on operating costs. For example, the automation of one of the largest business centers in Europe, British Airways in Harmondsworth, with a total project cost of about 302 million euros, allows saving up to 24 million euros annually. Savings are achieved due to more efficient operation of all systems of the building complex, as well as due to an increase in personnel productivity by approximately 20%. Compared to autonomous systems, the integrated system has the following advantages: - significant savings on cable networks and network equipment; - reduced energy consumption and increasing the reliability of the entire system; - increasing the efficiency of facility management; - graphical presentation of information about the state of systems and equipment at various levels (facility, zonal, address); - reducing labor costs of operational and dispatch services; - ensuring the necessary interaction of systems; reducing the likelihood of insured events; - the “openness” of the complex, providing the possibility of its expansion and the use of equipment from different manufacturers. The costs of constructing an intelligent building are higher than for the construction of buildings with a traditional composition of engineering equipment. However, we should not forget that the total cost of a building is the sum of construction costs and operating costs over the entire “life” of the building. The operation of an “average” building in Kyrgyzstan exceeds the cost of construction tens of times. We spend all the money on operation! The formation of an engineering infrastructure such as an intelligent building in a building significantly increases its liquidity. An intelligent building is an effective investment solution that can significantly reduce maintenance and development costs. Such a building meets modern international requirements and is an attractive investment.</p>

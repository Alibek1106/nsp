            <p class="project-page-text-p">The data processing center (DPC), owned by NSP, is a high-tech and secure space designed for storing and processing data, as well as ensuring the reliability and availability of information systems. This data center has many important systems and equipment that ensure its smooth operation. One of the key systems is the access control and management system, which ensures limited access to the premises only to authorized persons, thus ensuring the security and confidentiality of data. Climate control and refrigeration systems support optimal environmental conditions for server equipment, which prevents overheating and increases its reliability. A security alarm connected to the monitoring station of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic ensures a quick response to possible security incidents, and a video surveillance system serves to monitor and record events in the data center premises. Fire alarm systems alarms and fire suppression ensure that fires are quickly detected and extinguished, reducing the risk of equipment damage and data loss. Guaranteed power supply and grounding ensure uninterrupted operation of the data center even in the event of main power failures and protect against static electrical discharges. It is also important to note that the availability of equipment and fiber optic cables from five major ISP providers makes the data center an attractive location for organizations both from Kyrgyzstan and abroad, which contributes to customer diversity and global collaboration. This data center plays a critical role in ensuring data security and availability for various economic sectors and international companies.</p>

            <p class="project-page-text-p">Self-sufficiency in the agricultural sector is an important issue for any state. New IT technologies in the field of monitoring weather conditions allow us to solve any challenges of changing conditions. NSP has completed and continues to work on projects financed by donors such as UNDP, FAO and the World Bank to install AWS. The goal of these projects is to modernize weather stations for the use of data in agriculture of the Kyrgyz Republic. NSP is a certified partner of PESSL Instruments, a developer and manufacturer of weather observation products. The Suusamyr project was carried out in accordance with UNDP requirements. All necessary documents - design, diagram and permits were developed by the company in accordance with the customer’s conditions. The design documentation took into account the difficult conditions of the highlands. NSP used the necessary fastening materials from its own production. The project was completed under difficult conditions and was successfully delivered to the donor according to all requirements and conditions. The FAO project was aimed at installing and commissioning new AWSs in new territories in Kara Balta and Nooken. Additional sensors were installed at the AMS in Nooken. The company's engineers trained local farmers in using the stations. Currently, NSP is implementing a World Bank project to modernize 37 AWSs, inherited from Soviet times. The project includes the supply, installation and commissioning of AWS into a unified hydrometeorological network. The project is being created for Kyrgyzhydromet and is being implemented in a consortium with Siap+Micros, a leader in the production of hydrometeorological equipment.</p>

            <p class="project-page-text-p">In August 2011, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic announced a tender for the supply of industrial uninterruptible power supplies for the issuance and cash operations department. NSP has the status of an authorized business partner of a leading European UPS manufacturer. This allows us to offer high quality equipment that meets all international standards at the best prices. NSP's bid was declared the winner. In the process of implementing the Agreement, an early delivery of the MGE Galaxy 3500 UPS was carried out. Our company's engineers carried out timely installation of the equipment and put it into operation. This allowed the NBKR to ensure the energy security of a critical division. The MGE Galaxy 3500 model is an original product of the French manufacturer “APC by Schneider Electric” and is quality tested by the standards of the European Union and the Kyrgyz Republic. It is important to note that a special procedure for registering equipment ensures its guaranteed service by certified specialists.</p>
